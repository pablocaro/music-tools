# Music Tools - Project Context

## Overview
A playground for music tools and interactive web-based music experiments, primarily focused on piano visualization and sound synthesis.

## Project Structure

### Root Directory Files
- `index.html` - Main entry point for the project
- `script.js` - Main JavaScript file
- `README.md` - Basic project description

### Piano Implementations
The project contains several iterations of piano implementations, each exploring different features:

- **`piano.html`** - Initial piano implementation
- **`piano2.html`** - Second iteration
- **`piano-visual-only.html`** - Piano with visual-only focus (no sound)
- **`piano-refactored.html`** - Refactored version of the piano
- **`piano-experimental.html`** - Experimental piano features

### Piano Experimental (Modular Version)
- **`piano-experimental/`** - Modularized version of the piano implementation
  - `index.html` - Entry point
  - `script.js` - Main JavaScript logic
  - `styles.css` - Styling

### Other Tools
- **`tonejs-learning-lab.html`** - Learning lab for Tone.js experimentation
- **`sound-test.html`** - Sound testing utilities

## Technology Stack
- Web Audio API
- Tone.js (for sound synthesis)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5/CSS3

## Development Notes
- This is an experimental playground with multiple iterations
- Each piano implementation explores different approaches and features
- The `piano-experimental` directory represents the most modular approach

## Git Branch
Working branch: `claude/hello-world-011CUhgsin118RBEpJ1RDPRE`
